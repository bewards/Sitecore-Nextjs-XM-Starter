              <p>Thanks for using JSS!! Here are some resources to get you started:</p>
              <h3><a href="https://jss.sitecore.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documentation</a></h3>
              <p>The official JSS documentation can help you with any JSS task from getting started to advanced techniques.</p>
              <h3><a href="/component-patterns">Component Pattern Samples</a></h3>
              <p>There are a variety of implementation techniques that all yield the same final markup but have their own implementation pros and cons. This page defines those various component patterns as samples.</p>
              <h3><a href="/styleguide">JSS Styleguide</a></h3>
              <p>The JSS styleguide is a living example of how to use JSS, hosted right in this app.
              It demonstrates most of the common patterns that JSS implementations may need to use,
              as well as useful architectural patterns and Sitecore field types rendered with React components.&nbsp;The JSS samples are a boilerplate, not a library. That means that any code on this page is meant for you to own and customize to your own requirements.</p>
              <h3><a href="/dev/styles">Dev Styles</a></h3>
              <p>On this page is where we have collected our own Styleguide for the site.</p>
              <h3><a href="/dev/grid-system">Grid System</a></h3>
              <p>We have a sample use case of our Grid System.</p>
              <h3><a href="/graphql">GraphQL</a></h3>
              <p>JSS features integration with the Sitecore GraphQL API to enable fetching non-route data from Sitecore - or from other internal backends as an API aggregator or proxy.
              This route is a living example of how to use an integrate with GraphQL data in a JSS app.&nbsp;</p>
